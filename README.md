# File Splitter
Small tool I've made to split files down into set size chunks for uploading parts through a service that may require smaller files.

*If you have any ideas/issues with the software please let me know*

## Steps to compile (MacOS)

1. Download the "MacOS" folder from the source.
2. Download WxWidgets from their website [here](https://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/), make sure you get the *__"Source for Linux, MacOS etc"__*
3. Compile WxWidgets, if you are unsure as to how, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBv3FkFcPwI) tutorial is great.
4. Once compiled, __*copy*__ the alias of "wx-config" to the root of the MacOS folder from this repo that you downloaded.
5. Double click on the "build" script and wait till completion.
6. Run your freshly compiled application!

## Steps to compile (Windows)
TODO: Compile scripts to make the building process easier and write the compliation steps.
